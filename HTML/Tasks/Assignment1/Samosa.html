        🥟 Ingredients
        For the Dough (outer covering):->
        2 cups all-purpose flour (maida)
        4 tbsp oil or ghee
        ½ tsp carom seeds (ajwain)
        ½ tsp salt
        Water (to knead)

        For the Filling (potato stuffing):->
        3–4 medium boiled potatoes (mashed slightly)
        ½ cup green peas (boiled)
        2 green chilies (chopped)
        1 tsp grated ginger

        For Frying:->
        Enough oil for deep frying 
        👩‍🍳 Preparation Steps-----
        1. Make the Dough:->
        Take flour, salt, carom seeds in a bowl.
        Add oil/ghee and rub into the flour until crumbly.
        Add water little by little and knead into a firm dough (not too soft).
        Cover with a damp cloth and rest for 20–30 minutes.

        2. Prepare the Filling:->
        Heat oil in a pan.
        Add cumin seeds, fennel seeds, green chilies, ginger → sauté.
        Add boiled peas, then crumbled boiled potatoes.
        Mix in spices: coriander powder, chili powder, garam masala, amchur, and salt.
        Cook for 2–3 minutes, then cool the filling.

        3. Shape the Samosa:->
        Divide dough into lemon-sized balls.
        Roll each into an oval (about 6 inches long).
        Cut in half → makes 2 semi-circles.
        Take one semi-circle, fold into a cone shape, sealing the edge with water.
        Fill with potato mixture, then seal the top properly (press edges).

        4. Frying:->
        Heat oil on medium flame (not too hot).
        Fry samosas in batches until golden brown and crispy.
        Drain on paper towels.</pre>
