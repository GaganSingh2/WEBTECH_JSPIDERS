        👩‍🍳 Step-by-Step Cooking
        1. Marinate Chicken:->
        Mix chicken with yogurt, ginger-garlic paste, spices, salt, and lemon juice.
        Rest for at least 1 hour (overnight = better flavor).

        2. Cook Rice (70% cooked):->
        Boil water with salt + whole spices.
        Add soaked rice, cook till 70% done (still firm).
        Drain and keep aside.

        3. Prepare Masala:->
        Heat oil/ghee in a kadhai.
        Fry onions until golden brown → remove half (for garnish).
        To the rest, add tomatoes, green chilies, mint, coriander.
        Add marinated chicken → cook till chicken is 80% cooked.

        4. Layering (Dum Process):->
        In a heavy-bottom pan, spread some chicken masala at the bottom.
        Add a layer of rice.
        Sprinkle saffron milk, fried onions, mint, and coriander.
        Repeat layers until everything is used, finishing with rice on top.

        5. Dum Cooking:->
        Cover the lid tightly (seal edges with dough for authentic dum).
        Cook on low flame for 20–25 minutes.
        Let rest 10 minutes before serving.
