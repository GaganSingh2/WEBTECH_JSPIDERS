        <pre>
        🥘 Ingredients (for ~20 idlis)
        Idli rice / parboiled rice – 2 cups
        Urad dal (split black gram, husked) – 1 cup
        Fenugreek seeds (methi dana) – ½ tsp
        Salt – to taste
        Water – as needed
        Oil / ghee – for greasing molds

        👩‍🍳 Preparation Steps
        1. Soaking:->
        Wash and soak rice in water for 5–6 hours.
        Wash and soak urad dal + fenugreek seeds separately for 4–5 hours.

        2. Grinding:->
        Drain the water from urad dal and grind it into a smooth, fluffy paste (use little water).
        Grind rice into a slightly coarse paste (like fine semolina).
        Mix both batters in a large bowl.

        3. Fermentation:->
        Cover and leave the batter to ferment 8–12 hours in a warm place (overnight works best).
        The batter will rise and turn airy with a slight sour aroma.
        Add salt after fermentation and mix gently.

        4. Steaming Idlis:->
        Grease idli molds with oil/ghee.
        Pour batter into molds (fill about ¾).
        Place molds in a steamer (or pressure cooker without whistle).
        Steam for 10–12 minutes (don’t overcook, they’ll turn hard).
        Insert a toothpick – if it comes out clean, idlis are ready.</pre>
